# Remote_CMD
Remote CMD using WinAPI

## HOWTO

1. Build solution. Use CMD.exe for either server, service or cleint
2. Launch server by sending --server command to CMD.exe
3. If you want to install service, in binPath send --service
4. Launch client by sending --client "server_ip"

### TODO
1. Add multiple client support to server
2. Add reader and writer threads to client
3. Beautify code
